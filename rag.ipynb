    "RAG is a machine learning technique that combines document retrieval and generation models to create responses or summaries based on the context of a given query.\n",
    "The basic idea behind RAG is to first retrieve relevant documents from a large corpus of text, such as books, articles, or web pages, using techniques like keyword matching, topic modeling, or deep learning-based methods. These retrieved documents are then used as input for a generation model, such as a transformer-based language model, which synthesizes the information from the retrieved documents to generate a response.\n",
    "RAG has several advantages over traditional generation models, which rely solely on the context provided by the query itself. For example, RAG can provide more accurate and informative responses because it has access to additional contextual information beyond the query itself. It's also able to handle longer and more complex queries that contain multiple topics or concepts.\n",
    "RAG is being used in various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer service systems, where it can help improve response accuracy, speed, and relevance.\n",
